Problem Statement :

In the modern digital landscape, traditional shopping methods are increasingly being replaced by online platforms that offer greater convenience, accessibility, and efficiency. 
However, developing a full-scale e-commerce application can be complex and resource-intensive.
There is a need for a simplified, scalable, and easy-to-use solution that demonstrates the core functionalities of an online shopping system. 
The problem this project addresses is the absence of a lightweight e-commerce platform that enables users to browse and purchase products, 
while also allowing administrators to manage product listings and customer orders. 
The proposed Mini E-Commerce System aims to solve this by providing a web-based application with essential features such as user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, 
and order processing, supported by an intuitive admin panel. 
As online shopping becomes increasingly popular, users expect fast, accessible, and user-friendly platforms to meet their purchasing needs.
However, building a full-featured e-commerce system requires extensive development time, complex infrastructure, and high costs. For educational or small business purposes. 
There is a need for a miniature version of an e-commerce platform that captures the essential features without the overhead of large-scale development.
The system is intended to be lightweight but structured, providing a foundational model for e-commerce development that can later be scaled or 
extended with advanced features such as payment integration, real-time stock tracking, and analytics.
